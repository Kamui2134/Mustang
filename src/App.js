						<p className='p p-block-5-right-bottom'>
							Classic Recreations has been building officially licensed Shelby
							Mustangs for a while, and according to our friends at AUTOMOBILE,
							they're good. Really good. Recently, CR landed the license to
							build three more classic Mustangs: the 1969-1970 Boss 302, the
							1969-1970 Boss 429, and the 1969-1970 Mach 1. These aren't
							resto-mods, either. Underneath the vintage sheetmetal, you
							essentially get a brand new car.

							Combo Platter: Jim Weigle’s 1969/2014 Mustang is an exercise in

							When we first walked up to Jim Weigle’s all-black 1969 Mustang
							SportsRoof at the Carlisle Ford Nationals in 2017, it got our
							attention because it was straight as an arrow and with paint as

								Then we looked under the hood; “Nice, four-cam Cobra motor swap
								and it looks factory.” As we soon found out, it was. So What?
							</p>
							<p className='p'>
								That engine wasn’t even a dream in any engineers’ eyes in 1969.
								The deeper we looked, the more it became obvious what we were
								looking at. Jim very skillfully mated the 1969 body to the
								complete chassis and running gear of a 2014 Shelby GT500,
								complete with the full 2014 interior, accessories, and even fuel
								filler. And a few bug guts in the grille proved he drove it to
								Carlisle from his home in Parkersburg, West Virginia.
